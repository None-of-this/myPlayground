 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with.} 4. Bf4{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn.} 4... Bg7({ White has three main moves here:} 5.e3{ ,} 5.Nf3{  and} 5.Rc1{ . The first two are by far the more important (and flow into each other quite often), while} 5.Rc1{  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players.}) 5. e3 O-O{ The true starting point of the Bf4 lines.}({ This way, Black forces White to put the knight on f3 before committing to c5, and therefore avoid a huge chunk of theory connected with} 5...c5 6.dxc5 Qa5 7.Rc1 dxc4 8.Bxc4 O-O 9.Nge2{ , which also stands reasonably well right now, but would require a lot of very concrete (and memory-demanding) knowledge in order to make a forced draw.}) 6. Nf3 c5 7. dxc5 Qa5 8. Rc1{ The only serious move in this position.} 8... dxc4 9. Bxc4 Qxc5 10. Bb3{ Once again, the only proper move here.} 10... Nc6{ The main move, and the one that promises full equality. But I wanted to mention that we have a decent-ish alternative here for those games where we feel like defending a slightly worse endgame instead of having to recall long lines of tactics.} 11. O-O{ Knight jumps from c3 are very non-threatening when we have Qa5+ in reply, but they are a problem now, so the queen moves away.} 11... Qa5 12. h3!{ Does a double job of stopping Bg4 and giving the Bf4 the h2-square in case of Nh5. And now that Bg4 is cut off, White would like to play e3-e4 and start gaining space in the center. Doing it without h3 would invite Bg4! and Black's counterplay with Rd8 and possibly Nd4 later develops very naturally.}( 12.Nd4{  should be met with} 12...Bd7!{  − there is no reason to give White some play along the e-file with} 12...Nxd4 13.exd4!{  followed by Re1.}) 12... Bf5{ The most natural move here. We want to play Rd8, but more importantly, we want to be able to prevent White from expanding with e3-e4.} 13. Qe2( 13.Nd4{  will once again be met with} 13...Bd7!{  not biting on the invitation to open the e-file for the white rook.}) 13... Ne4!{ Not allowing e3-e4 is crucial.} 14. Nd5{ Used to be the absolute main, in fact pretty much the only move for a very long time, and Black definitely needs to know what to do here still.} 14... e5!{ Among other things, White was threatening Bc7.} 15. Bg5!?{ The most recent try, which leads to some very spectacular lines, but should be a forced draw with precise play.} 15... Nxg5 16. Nxg5 Qd8!{ It’s important to take the e7-square under control.}({ A sample line to illustrate why} 16...h6?{  doesn't work.} 17.Rxc6 bxc6 18.Ne7+ Kh8 19.Nxf7+ Kh7 20.Nxf5 gxf5 21.Qh5{  and Black is lost due to White's mating construction}{  with Ng5+ and Qg6.}) 17. h4!({ This idea, introduced in 2009, briefly revived this old line which used to be considered borderline unplayable due to} 17.Nf3 e4 18.Nd2 Qg5{  and Black's play is faster than anything White is doing.}) 17... h6 18. g4! Bd7 19. Ne4 Qxh4 20. f3{ This is the point of 17.h4!? − by giving up on h4, White establishes a very nice pair of knights, and is planning to play Rf2-h2 and then launch a direct attack on the black king. However, by playing energetically and challenging the white setup, Black equalizes.} 20... Kh8!{ We need to be able to play f5.} 21. Rf2 f5 22. Rh2 Qd8 23. gxf5 Bxf5 24. Qg2 Na5! 25.Bc4 ({ Once again, Black's strategy is to start challenging the white setup. A sample line could be} 25.Qh1 Nxb3 26.Rc7!( 26.Rxh6?? Kg8!{  and suddenly White is helpless since} 27.Rc7{  can be met with} 27...Rf7!{  here.}) 26...Kg8 27.Ne7+ Kf7 28.Nd5+ Kg8{ . A very cute computer-generated draw.})
